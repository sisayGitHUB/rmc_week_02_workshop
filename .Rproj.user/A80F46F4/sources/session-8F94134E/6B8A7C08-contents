Non-Communicable Disease Burden (NCD)

```{r }
# Load necessary packages
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, knitr, here, ggplot2)

# Import the non-communicable diseases data
data_ncd <- read_csv(here("data/burden-of-disease-ncd.csv"))
head(data_ncd, 5)
```
Filtering the necessary dataset 
```{r}
# Filter the dataset to include only the three countries chosen by your group.
data_ncd_mini <- data_ncd %>%
  filter(Entity %in% c("India","China","Ghana","Ethiopia")) %>%
 rename(DALY = colnames( data_ncd)[4]) %>%
  select(-Code)
head(data_ncd_mini, 5)
  
```

Table of Estimates for NCD Burden Over Time

```{r}
# Here render a table for the DALY burden over time for the three countries. 
# You should pivot the data wider to show each country in a separate column.
data_ncd_wide <- data_ncd_mini %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Entity,         # Country becomes column names
    values_from = DALY)  # Values to be spread across country
# Use kable() from the knitr package to render the table.

data_ncd_wide_table <- knitr::kable(data_ncd_wide,  "simple")
data_ncd_wide_table
```

Plot Showing Trends in NCD Burden Over Time

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Here, plot a line graph showing the trend of DALY burden for the chosen countries over time. You can use ggplot2 to create this plot. Each country's line should be a different color.
# NOTE: Use your long 'mini' data frame for plotting, not the wide data used for the table. 
ggplot(data_ncd_mini, aes(x = Year, y = DALY, color = Entity, group = Entity)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.2) +                # Line size
  geom_point(size = 3) +                 # Adding points to the line
  labs(title = "DALY Burden Trend Over Time", 
       x = "Year", 
       y = "DALY Burden",
       color = "Country") +              # Label for color legend
  theme_minimal()  

```

Summary of NCD Burden Findings

From the finding we observe that China and Ethiopia has shown a remarkable decline in the DALY from 1990 to 2020. On the other hand, Ghana has  shown a steady change over tthe specified period. Among the four country, the maximum DALY value was seen by Ethiopians In the late time back in 1990 while the min is by Chinese in 2020.
